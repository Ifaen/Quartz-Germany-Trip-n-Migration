#### What is this?
This is a small notes project made to easily share my notes with my friends in an interactive way. The notes are in Spanish because we are still learning English.

#### The reason
A few dreams of mine are being able to learn new languages (ideally German or French), live in another country, get a cool job and resources for my personal projects, family and hobbies.
But also, If I can do it in company of my friends who have similar goals, then I need to prepare and do everything to make it a reality.

#### Why Germany?
There are many reasons to be honest, but to be brief, I like their language and culture, landscapes, tech field, the opportunities they have available for us (Chileans), and above all, because is a path that would allow me to provide for my parents in Chile, get a lot of experience in my work field and even, study and land a job in what I really want to do that is something related with Robotics, Automation or Prosthesis.

#### My objective
I don't know for certain if I will adapt to Germany, and I'm from a low income household so, I want to make sure to pave the path of lowest risk at first. In a way that if I am unable to continue, it doesn't become a burden.

The more I know, everything here might change, but for now I want to gain experience in my country, save the max possible money and then try possible paths to get to see on-site Germany. Even via Volunteers Visa which would be really helpful.

After that, if everything else aligns, I want to do a Masters study in Robotics or something related to IT and settle there.

Ideally, to get a semi remote job, so I can visit family and friends back in my home country every once in a while.
